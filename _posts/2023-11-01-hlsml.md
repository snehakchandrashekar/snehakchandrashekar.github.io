Implement real-time machine learning for jet tagging on FPGAs to overcome latency issues and enhance data processing efficiency.

Explored the different handles provided by the tool to optimize the inference - Latency, throughput, and resource usage.

Made our inference more computationally efficient with compression and quantization.

Translated models into synthesizable FPGA code for real-time jet tagging using hls4ml using Vivado HLS.

Achieved a 48% reduction in resource utilization while maintaining high performance.
