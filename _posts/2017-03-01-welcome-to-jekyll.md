IoT-based Solar Tracking and Monitoring System

Technologies: Internet of Things(IoT) Tools: Arduino IDE, MATLAB, Wi-Fi module processor, Motor driver, Solar Panel, Voltage and Current sensors Programming language: C++, MATLAB

Description: The project comprises a solar tracking system and a monitoring system for optimal panel positioning. The tracking system is the one that rotates the solar panel to the maximum solar intensity point. On the other hand, a monitoring system uses sensors to measure current, voltage, and light intensity and send it to the user's mobile through IoT.

This system resulted in a 30% increase in efficiency compared to non-tracking systems.
