Welcome!

I am currently a graduate student pursuing an MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz. My area of expertise lies in Hardware ASIC design, with a strong academic background and practical experience in digital systems and VLSI design. I am scheduled to graduate in 2025.

I completed my BE in Electrical and Electronics at The National Institute of Engineering, Mysuru.

I worked as an application development analyst for approximately three years at Accenture Solutions Pvt. Ltd in Bengaluru, India.

I love traveling and photography. You can check my photos at Unsplash [https://unsplash.com/@itssnehac]
