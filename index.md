Welcome to My Personal Space!

I am currently a graduate student at the University of California, Santa Cruz, pursuing my MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering. My passion and expertise are in Hardware Design, and I have a deep academic foundation complemented by hands-on experience in Digital Systems, Circuit design and VLSI Design. I am excited to be on track to graduate in 2025.

Before embarking on this journey, I earned my Bachelor of Engineering in Electrical and Electronics from the National Institute of Engineering, Mysuru. Following that, I had the privilege of working as an Application Development Analyst at Accenture Solutions Pvt. Ltd., Bengaluru, where I spent nearly three years solving real-world challenges and honing my skills in innovative problem-solving.

Beyond academics and work, I'm an avid traveler and photography enthusiast. Capturing the world through my lens gives me a sense of adventure and creativity.
